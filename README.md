For building and running the application you need:

JDK 1.8
Maven 3

Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in the com.myuserapp.test.api.UserMaintApp.UserMaintAppApplication class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the Spring Boot Maven plugin like so:

mvn spring-boot:run
